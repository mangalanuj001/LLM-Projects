**Project 1** - Sentiment Analysis - Large Language Model (LLM): A Sentiment Analysis with Customer Product Reviews
1. Introduction
Nowadays due to the digital marketing and social media, the companies deal with a huge amount of the customer reviews, articles, and comments. In order to encounter this very enormous increase in data volume, subjectivity, and heterogeneity different tools can be used. Today’s article will however concentrate on a very important business approach known as Sentiment Analysis using a Large Language Model (LLM) for exploration of the effectiveness of the company’s marketing campaigns and product reviews left by customers.

2. What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis can be used to identify and extract subjective information from text (left on companies’ websites or social media), such as customer opinions, customer attitudes, appraisals, emotions, etc. to determines whether the customer review is positive, negative, or neutral. The main idea of Sentiment Analysis is to use computational methods, train the models and automatically classify the digital text like a human would do.

Use Cases:
Product Analysis: Sentiment Analysis helps to learn more about your product, use the feedback and so spots the advantages and drawbacks, improve the service, and even discovers the new potential features.
Customer Analysis/ Employee Feedback Analysis: using the reviews data identify gaps and so improve customer experience.
Market Research:Analysis and research of the market trends: gathering valuable insights about the current products and future trends.
Social Media Monitoring: Analysis of the success of the company media performance, customer acceptance of the product or detection new trends.
Approaches:
LLMs: LLMs can understand the context in which words and phrases are used, leading to an accurate sentiment classification. In this code we will use a LLM with customer reviews to perform sentimemnt analysis and understand if the customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with the product. 

**Project 2 ** - Content categorization
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for topic tagging due to their ability to understand and generate human-like text, enabling efficient and accurate categorization of content. LLMs can be leveraged for various topic modeling and tagging tasks, including: identifying topics within documents, generating labels for identified topics, and enhancing the overall topic modeling process. 
LLMs for Topic Tagging: How it Works
1. Document Embedding: LLMs are used to convert text documents into numerical representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning. 
2. Topic Modeling: Techniques like BERTopic, combined with LLMs, can be used to identify and group similar documents into clusters based on their embeddings. 
3. Topic Labeling: LLMs can then generate descriptive labels for these clusters (topics) by analyzing the key terms and content within each group. 
4. Fine-tuning: LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific topic modeling tasks, such as literature mining or quantitative political analysis, to improve their performance. 
Advantages of using LLMs for Topic Tagging:
Improved Accuracy:LLMs can capture nuanced semantic relationships within text, leading to more accurate topic identification. 
Efficiency:LLMs can process large volumes of text much faster than traditional methods, enabling rapid topic extraction and labeling. 
Contextual Understanding:LLMs can understand the context of text, allowing for more relevant and meaningful topic assignments. 
Automation:LLMs can automate the entire topic modeling pipeline, from embedding generation to label creation. 
Enhanced Interpretability:LLMs can generate human-readable labels, making it easier to understand and interpret the identified topics. 

Applications of LLM-based Topic Tagging:
Content Organization:LLMs can be used to organize large collections of documents, such as articles, research papers, or customer feedback, into relevant topics. 
Information Retrieval:Topic tagging can improve search and retrieval of information by allowing users to search for specific topics. 
Trend Analysis:LLMs can be used to identify emerging trends and patterns in text data by analyzing the evolution of topics over time. 
Customer Support:LLMs can be used to categorize customer inquiries and route them to the appropriate support channels based on their topic. 
Narrative Text Analysis:LLMs can be used to analyze narrative texts, such as novels or news articles, to identify key themes and storylines. 
Literature Mining:LLMs can be used to extract and analyze topics from scientific literature to identify research gaps and areas of focus.
